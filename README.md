# LEGO LAND SAWMILLS

## Introduction: The sawmills in LEGO land
Daily woodcutters of LEGO land cut trees in the mountains. Every tree trunk is precise 1, 2, 3, etc
blocks in length. This is LEGO land you know! Trees are mere simple blocks. The weak spot of a tree
is the trunk, so woodcutters cut the tree from the ground. Then the leaves are removed. At the end of
the day the woodcutters throw the tree trunks in any order they like into the river.
More downstream there is a sawmill to where the tree trunks will float. The river has the same width
as the tree trunks and therefore tree trunks cannot overtake each other. So, the first tree trunk the
woodcutters throw into the river will arrive first at the sawmill. The space between tree trunks is
neglectable. In LEGO land everything fits very precise.
When the woodcutters return from their work, they will turn the sawmill on. Unfortunately, the
machine is old, and the speed cannot be regulated anymore. The mechanics are broken, so every 3
blocks it just makes a cut. For example, if the first tree trunk is 4 blocks in length, then it will produce
sawn wood of length 3 and a remainder of length 1. If a next trunk is again 4 block in length, then it
will produce sawn wood of length of 2 and, a remainder of length 2.
Unfortunately, by the specific building rules in LEGO land, only sawn wood of length 2 is used by the
carpenters. To be more precise:
 Sawn wood of length of 1 has a profit of -1. It costs money to get rid of it.
 Sawn wood of length 2 has a profit of +3.
 Luckily, sawn wood of length 3 can still be sold for +1 as it can be shortened by the carpenters
themself.
